# Fast Neural Style Transfer using Pytorch Models

This repository implements Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution paper by Justin Johnson, Alexandre Alahi, and Fei-Fei Li, using pretrained VGG models in Pytorch models. Model architecture and training methodology is same, but hyper parameters are different. Pretrained models being different the loss function and relative strengths of style loss, content loss and variation loss needed to be recalibrated. 

## Tasks done

1. Network ready and training procedure complete
2. Trainig works, also added html presentation of intermediate results

## Tasks pending

1. Code Organization not done
2. Not getting good results as of now. More options for hyper parameters need to be evaluated

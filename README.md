# Fast Neural Style Transfer using Pytorch Models

This repository implements Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution paper by Justin Johnson, Alexandre Alahi, and Fei-Fei Li, using pretrained VGG models in Pytorch models. Model architecture and training methodology is same, but hyper parameters are different. Pretrained models being different the loss function and relative strengths of style loss, content loss and variation loss needed to be recalibrated. 

Was able to replicate results shown in the paper below with pretrained VGG models provided on the webpage.

1. Now trying to replicate the results for VGG pretrained models available in Pytorch Library

2. Will Try to replicate the results for ResNet. My understanding says that it will give similar results. Might be interesting to see those results.

3.
